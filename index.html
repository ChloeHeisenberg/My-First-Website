            <article>
                <p>So, for the past 6 months I've been learning how to code in <em>Python</em> and <em>SQL</em> (focusing mostly on Back End): 
                    studying syntax, grinding algorythms, cracking exercises on <a href="https://codewars.com" rel="no_follow" target="_blank">Codewars.com</a> 
                    and I would lie if I said coding has never made me cry, but so far it's been a lovely journey and I cannot wait to begin 
                    learning HTML & CSS and publish my first website! <br> I still remeber some HTML/CSS back from my blogging days 
                    (the good ol'days) and I plan on continuing to expand my knowledge in Front End Web Development. There's so much to learn and 
                    there are so many things I don't know yet, but I am excited to start my class on <strong>Full Stack Web Development</strong> 
                    (with a little help from <a href="https://roadmap.sh" rel="no_follow" target="_blank">Roadmap.sh</a> and 
                    <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" rel="no_follow" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, of course).</p>

        </figure>
        <h2>The plan for now is:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Practice HTML</li>
            <li>Gain a good understanding of CSS</li>
            <li>Learn JavaScript</li>
            <li>Study frameworks</li>
            <li>Get better at coding in Python</li>
            <li>Master SQL</li>
            <li>Practice Git more</li>
            <li>Stop being overwhelmed by GitHub</li>
            <li>Learn how to center <em>div</em></li>
        </ol>
        <button class="button button1">
            Test button
        </button>
        <p>This landing page is looking a bit lousy and dull now, but I hope once I get a full grasp on Javascript and frameworks, 
            this website would gradually increase in its complexity and just appears less lousy and dull.</p>
